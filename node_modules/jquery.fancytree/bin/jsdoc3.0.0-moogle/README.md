The default template for JSDoc 3 uses: [the Taffy Database library](http://taffydb.com/) and the [Underscore Template library](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#template).

Modified by Martin Wendt in 2012.

* Add a 'Methods:' section for class views, between 'Properties:' and 'Methods details'
* Add google analytics hooks
* Add a 'Fork me on Github'

**NOTE:** this template was based on jsdoc 3.0.0 and is not compatible with recent versions.
